# Fizz-Buzz-CI-CD
This is a repository to show continuous integration / continuous delivery on the example of the FizzBuzz problem

Here I demonstrate of how one can setup basic CI/CD using GitHub.
My inspiration comes from the following authors:

1. Vladimir Iglovikov wrote a great tutorial for setting up a CI/CD pipeline.
See [Nine steps for better looking python code](https://towardsdatascience.com/nine-simple-steps-for-better-looking-python-code-87e5d9d3b1cf).

2. Joel Grus' [Ten Essays on Fizz Buzz](https://joelgrus.com/2020/06/06/ten-essays-on-fizz-buzz/) where he describes ways to solve the Fizz Buzz coding exercise. While it provides the 10 solutions, it is more a discussion on Python, Maths, Testing and Coding. And if you don't know who is Joel Grus, check out his presentation about his everalasting [love towards Jupyter Notebooks](https://youtu.be/7jiPeIFXb6U).
